In order to create a microservice that responds to "Hello World" you first need a controller.

Create a Controller:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/example/micronaut/HelloController.java
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/java/example/micronaut/HelloController.java[]
----

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Controller.html[@Controller] annotation mapped to the path `/hello`
<2> The http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get] annotation is used to map the index method to all requests that use an HTTP GET
<3> By default a Micronaut's response uses `application/json` as `Content-Type`. We are returning a String not a JSON object. Because of that, we set it to `text/plain`.
<4> A String "Hello World" is returned as the result
